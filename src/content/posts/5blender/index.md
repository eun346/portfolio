# My Blender Tutorial Experience
Recently, I decided to dive into 3D modeling using **Blender**, a free and powerful 3D creation tool, as preparation for future **Unity** projects. I followed two excellent YouTube tutorials:

- [Blender Floor Plan Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94kAIpRnhcY)

# Understanding the Basics
Before starting, I clarified essential 3D modeling concepts.  

| Term       | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `Mesh`     | A combination of vertices (points), edges (lines), faces (polygons), or any combination of these. |
| `Geometry` | Any 3D object with position data, including meshes, curves, instances, volumes, etc. |
| `Instance` | A duplicate of an object sharing the same underlying data as the original. |
| `Shader`   | A program controlling how light interacts with a surface, affecting color, reflection, transparency, and emission. In Blender, itâ€™s often used interchangeably with `material`. |

ðŸ’¡ *Why this matters:* Without a mental model, Blender can feel overwhelming. Once I understood mesh editing and modifiers, everything started to make sense.

# Step-by-Step Experience

## Tutorial 1: [Blender Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ci3Has4L5W4)
This tutorial covered the fundamentals:  
- Navigating Blenderâ€™s viewport  
- Useful shortcuts for efficiency  
- Differences between **Edit Mode** and **Object Mode**  
- Building a simple object step by step  

### Essential Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| `Middle Mouse` | Orbit around scene |
| `Shift + Middle Mouse` | Pan view |
| `Mouse Wheel Scroll` | Zoom in/out |
| `Tab` | Switch between Object/Edit Mode |
| `N` | Toggle Sidebar |

For **Object Mode**:
| Shortcut | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| `T` | Toggle Toolbar |
| `G` | Move objects |
| `R` | Rotate objects |
| `S` | Scale (resize) objects |
| `Shift + A` | Add object |
| `Alt` (when adding) | Add object in perfect form (e.g., perfect cube or triangle) |
| `Ctrl + L` | Link properties between objects |

ðŸ’¡ *Tip:* For more shortcuts, check Blenderâ€™s [Keymap Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/keymap/introduction.html).

### Recommended Setup
- Go to `Edit > Preferences > Interface` and adjust the **Resolution Scale**  
ðŸ’¡ *Why:* Makes Blender easier to work with depending on your screen size.  

- Check your GPU under `System > Cycles Render Devices > CUDA`  
ðŸ’¡ *Why:* Ensures hardware acceleration for faster rendering.  

- Increase **Undo Steps** to **100** in `System > Memory & Limits`  
ðŸ’¡ *Why:* Allows more flexibility when correcting mistakes.

### Making a Cookie

#### 1. Cookie Base
- Add a **Cylinder** (`Shift + A > Mesh > Cylinder`)  
- Scale (`S`) to flatten into a cookie shape  
- Smooth surface: Right-click â†’ `Shade Smooth`  
- Rename to **Cookie** in the Outliner  

#### 2. Chocolate Chips
- Add a **UV Sphere** (`Shift + A > Mesh > UV Sphere`)  
- Scale down (`S`) to chip size  
- Position using **Move** (`G`)  
- Duplicate chips (`Shift + D`) and place around the cookie  

#### 3. Tray
- Add a **Cube** (`Shift + A > Mesh > Cube`)  
- Scale and move to sit under cookie  
- Enter **Edit Mode** (`Tab`), select top face, use **Inset Faces** (`I`)  
- Extrude inner face down (`E`) to create tray depth  

#### 4. Materials & Colors
- Add material in **Material Properties** â†’ `New`  
- Choose **Base Color** for cookie, chips, and tray  
- To quickly assign the same material, select chips â†’ last chip with material â†’ `Ctrl + L > Materials`  

#### 5. Lighting & Rendering
- Delete default light â†’ Add **Area Light** (`Shift + A > Light > Area`)  
- Position camera (`0` on numpad, enable **Camera to View**)  
- Set render engine to **Cycles** for realism  
- Render with `F12` â†’ Save via `Image > Save As`

## Tutorial 2: [Blender Floor Plan Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94kAIpRnhcY)
This tutorial focused on combining objects and creating a full scene:  
- Importing and scaling floor plan images  
- Modeling floors and walls  
- Applying materials, lighting, and render settings  

### 3D Floor Plan Creation

#### 1. Setup
- Download a floor plan image  
- Open Blender, select all (`A`) and delete (`X`) default objects  
- Import image â†’ Creates an Empty object  
- Reset location & rotation: `Alt + G`, `Alt + R`  
- Switch to Top Orthographic View (`7` on numpad)  
- Set **Units** to Metric (Scene Properties â†’ Units â†’ Metric â†’ Meters)  

#### 2. Floor & Walls
- Add **Plane** â†’ Rename to **Floor**  
- Set dimensions in Item Sidebar â†’ Apply scale (`Ctrl + A > Scale`)  
- In **Edit Mode**, delete face (`X > Only Faces`)  
- Extrude vertices (`E`) along X/Y to match outer walls  
- Extrude inner walls for rooms  

#### 3. Finalizing & Rendering
- Duplicate floor â†’ rename **Background**, delete faces, extrude outline  
- Hide Floor/Background, select Walls â†’ Extrude upwards along Z-axis (`E`)  
- Add **Solidify Modifier** (Complex mode, adjust thickness)  
- Check **Face Orientation** (Blue = correct, Red = flipped) â†’ Fix flipped faces (`Shift + N`)  
- Save your work (`Ctrl + S`)

ðŸ’¡ *Final Tip:* Always organize objects, name them clearly, and save iterations frequently. This keeps projects manageable as scenes get complex.
