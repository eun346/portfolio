# Understanding the Basics
**ROS (Robot Operating System)**
- A set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications
- It provides communication, control, and simulation tools for modular robot development

ROS2 is similar to ROS(1) but the big differences are that ROS2 is faster and based on DDS(Data Distribution Service).

**Node**
![NODE](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/_images/Nodes-TopicandService.gif)
- A small executable program that communitcate each other by publishing and subscribing

**Topic**
- The channel for sending data between nodes
- 1:N or N:N communication

**Parameter**
- Configurable values that modify nodesâ€™ behaviors

**Service**
- Request - response structure (1:1)
- Good for short, deterministic tasks
- .srv file

**Action**
- Request -> Feedback -> Result
- Used for long-running tasks
- .action file

**Interfaces**
- Communication formats:
    - .msg, .srv, .action

**Launch**
- Tool to run multiple nodes with configuration
- Written in Python 

**Composition**
- Run multiple nodes inside a single process.
- Faster than using separate processes (launch).

**Executor**
- Handle callbacks (subscriptions, timers, etc.)
    - Single-threaded: runs callbacks sequentially
    - Multi-threaded: runs callbacks in parallel
