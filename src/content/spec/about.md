## Background
I am a Mechanical Engineering major at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu). My interest in technology started in middle school, when I first began learning programming languages. Since then, I have continued to grow my skills, combining engineering with coding.  

Currently, I am a member of the [MEIC Laboratory](https://www.meic-lab.com), where I work on projects at the intersection of mechanical systems and innovative technologies. Recently, I have been particularly focused on **Extended Reality (MR)** and its applications.
